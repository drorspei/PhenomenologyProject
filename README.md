# PhenomenologyProject
Android app to study the self

App lets you define questions you wish to be asked randomly during the day, allowing you to chain questions depending on your answers.

For example, you can add the question "Are you hungry?" with the answers "Yes" and "No", and having both answers, once clicked, show the question "Did you eat in last 3 hours?".

Answers are saved in the file `Documents/savedphenomena.json` in a simple json format. There is currently no UI for doing anything with saved answers. For the first few weeks of the project I'm going to pull the files and look at them manually on my computer, and later figure out good ways of visualizing the data.
